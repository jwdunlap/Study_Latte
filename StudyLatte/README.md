Application Name: Study-Latte
General Description:
Study-Latte is a platform designed for eliminating the frustration of finding coffee shops with available seats at which to work or study. Many times we have run into the problem where we want to study at a coffee shop, but then whenever we arrive there isn’t a single table to sit at. Unlike existing services such as Google Maps’ “Popular Times” feature, our app displays real-time data concerning whether seats are open.
A core focus of the design is the ease of operation. On the business side, coffee shop employees simply need to press a button signaling when they have seats available. On the customer side, users simply press a button if they arrive at a coffee shop and find there are no seats. It’s that simple.
